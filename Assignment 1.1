1. Various sources of Big Data:

              Social websites

              docs

              archieves

              Media

              public sites

              Stored data

              Online transactions

              Banking datas


2.3 Vs  of Big Data:


   1.Volume-> The size of the data. Day by data the users are increased in all                social sites and the datas are increasing endlessly.

   2.Variety-> Different types of data. The data will be in many formats like                docs,Excel,Xml,images,videos etc.

   3.Velocity->The speed at which the data is generated. The growing of data at a                particular time is increased day by day. Ex:Facebook generates 9PB                data at every day.



3. Horizontal scaling and vertical scaling:


   Horizontal Scaling->  Its also called as Scaling out.

             Use multiple commodity machines and distribute the loadof              storage/processing among them
 Economical and quick to implement as it              focuses on distribution of load Instead of having a single system              with tera bytes of storage we can use the multiple systems as              distributed
.
   Vertical Scaling->  Its also called as Scaling up.

             Increase the configuration of a single system
 Like disk capacity,              RAM, data transfer speed
 Complex, costly, and time consuming process
 

 
4. Need and working of hadoop:

      
              In the big data there are volume, variety, velocity. To handle such                large volume of data and to overcome their helplessness companies                  like Google and Yahoo! needed to find solutions to manage all the               data that their servers were gathering in an efficient, cost               effective way.
The Hadoop provides the framework to perform the above                          work.It processes and storages thessss large volume of datas in a                  distributed manner.It uses HDFS and Map Reduce Engine to do the job.
